# RustChess  
Chess game in Rust using Vulkan Graphics API  

We have the basic functionalities of a chess game as a console application.  
--> Players can only make valid moves  
--> Opponent pieces can be captured  
--> Players can lose when their King is in check and cannot be saved in one move  

## DONE:  
 - Fix Rook Bug (movement bug)  
 - Intergrate Vulkan Visualization  
 - Intersection Tests for Fields  
 - Create 3D Models  
 - Fancy Shader  
 - Dumb AI and AI communication with graphics engine  

## TODOs:  
 - Improve Intersection Tests for Models and Fields  
 - Animation, not actually Animations, but a function that changes the position of a piece slowly rather then instantly move the piece.  
 - Smart AI Player  
 - Rotate Knight Normals  
 - Rotate Bishop
