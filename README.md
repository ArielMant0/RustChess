# RustChess  
Chess game in Rust using Vulkan Graphics API  
  
We have the basic functionalities of a chess game as a console application.
--> Players can only make valid moves
--> Opponent pieces can be captured
--> Players can lose when their King is in check and cannot be saved in one move
  
TODOs:  
Fix Rook Bug (movement bug)  
Intergrate Vulkan Visualization
Intersection Tests for Models and Fields  
Create 3D Models  
Animation, not actually Animations, but a function that changes the position of a piece slowly rather then instantly move the piece.  
AI Player (dumb and smart)
